### Hi!

I‚Äôm Lukas, a post-doctoral researcher at the University of Glasgow in the lab of Philippe Schyns. I did my PhD at the psychology department of the University of Amsterdam, supervised by Dr. Steven Scholte and Dr. Suzanne Oosterwijk. I‚Äôm interested in how techniques and models from machine learning can complement existing methodologies in psychology and cognitive neuroscience. My favorite domain to apply these ideas and techniques is (emotional) face perception. Currently, in my post-doc, I explore how artificial (deep) neural networks process faces and how this differs from human face processing.
